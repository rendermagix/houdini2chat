Pointers:
- For Network Visualization tasks, there is nothing here to help.

General Houdini Guidelines
- Use latest stable version of Houdini (20.5)
- Always verify the syntax of functions used in your code
- when I ask about python node (which is inside the HDA), please don't assume that i am referring to the HDA itself (parent node)

Python Node Guidelines
- Use latest HOM documentation (Houdini Object Documentation) [HOM Documentation](../../docs/houdini_20_5_hom_python_houdini_object_model_all_documentation.txt)
